  Howdy! This project is just getting started. Check back soon to see how you can get involved.

The <a href="http://debates.org/">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> (CPD) is the organization responsible for organizing the nationally televised Presidential debates that occur during each U.S. Presidential election cycle. It is a non-profit corporation run jointly by the Republican and Democratic parties. These two political parties have colluded over the years to exclude any other participants in the Presidential debates. The time has come for their monopolistic behavior to end.

Several smaller political parties, including the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, have sued the CPD in an attempt gain access to the debates. These lawsuits have been unsuccessful. It is time for *We The People* to target the CPD's <a href="http://debates.org/index.php?page=national-debate-sponsors">sponsors</a> and <a href="http://debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates">hosts</a> to get them to force the CPD to change their inclusion policies.

This site is the first step in organizing *We The People*, of all political persuasions, who are not represented by either of the two major parties, to open the Presidential debate club to a broader range of political views and candidates. It is time.

More info coming very soon...
