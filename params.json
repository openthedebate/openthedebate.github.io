  "body": "# Open The Debate.\r\nThe [Commission on Presidential Debates](http://debates.org/) (CPD) is the organization responsible for organizing the nationally televised Presidential debates that occur during each U.S. Presidential election cycle. It is a non-profit corporation run jointly by the Republican and Democratic parties. These two political parties have colluded over the years to exclude any other participants in the Presidential debates. The time has come for their monopolistic behavior to end.\r\n\r\nSeveral smaller political parties, including the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, have sued the CPD in an attempt gain access to the debates. These lawsuits have been unsuccessful. It is time for _We The People_ to target the CPD's [sponsors](http://debates.org/index.php?page=national-debate-sponsors) and [hosts](http://debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates) to get them to force the CPD to change their inclusion policies.\r\n\r\nThis site is the first step in organizing _We The People_, of all political persuasions, who are not represented by either of the two major parties, to open the Presidential debate club to a broader range of political views and candidates. It is time. \r\n\r\nMore info coming very soon...\r\n\r\nopenthedebateclub at gmail.com",
